# Gaze correction project

## Description:
During the pandemic, the number of video calls increased due to the self-isolation regime. Often during conversations, people's eyes are directed at the screen rather than at the camera. It turns out that the conversation partners are looking in different directions during the dialogue, and their eyes are half-covered or looking sideways during the call.

We propose to solve this problem by modifying the eye pupil image during a video conversation.
As a result of the algorithm, we will get open eyes looking into the camera and happy partners communicating eye-to-eye.

Although we plan to apply our algorithm to video, we have to start with a small step.
Our first stage was to implement it on photos.
We used selfies of ourselves and other people as our main dataset.
During the process of dataset generation, it was essential to select photos that cover as much as possible the potential cases that appear in the process of communication on a video call. These are covered eyes, eyes looking sideways, squinted eyes.
